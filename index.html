		<p>ANNUAL INTER HOUSE CHOIR FESTIVAL
Tuesday, July 18th, 2017
 


It was a moment of immense pride for the school as H.E Mr. F.K. Morule, High Commissioner, High Commission of the Republic of South Africa presided over as the Chief Guest at the Valedictory Function of the Africa Week organized on the occasion of International Mandela Day in the school on 18th July 2017. Present on the occasion were H.E. Ms. Judith K.K. Kangoma Kapijlmpanga, High Commissioner of Republic of Zambia, Dr. Wael Albattrekhi, Minister-Counsellor, Deputy Chief of the Mission, Embassy of the State of Palestine and the parents of the students from Tanzania, Ghana and Palestine studying in the school.

The Annual Event was a long standing tradition to honour and celebrate the humanitarian ideals of Dr. Nelson Mandela and witnessed the culmination of the Africa Week held from July 11th to July 14th 2017 during which the students wrote slogans, essays, poems and articles on the theme "Action Against Poverty".

Paying rich tributes to the icon of peace, Principal Dr. Jyoti Bose urged the students "to uphold values and beliefs of Nelson Mandela by translating them into action for the benefit of society."

The School Choir traced the history of South African struggle for freedom by rendering a medley of songs in Zulu. In an endeavour to sensitize the younger generation to Nelson Mandela's 'long walk to freedom', a short film produced by the BBC on 'Nelson Mandela - His Life Story' was screened and the students presented articles and audio video presentations. In a befitting tribute to Dr. Mandela, the talented dancers of the school presented the song "Asimbonanga" originally sung by Joan Baez. The song echoed the victorious celebrations of the people when their Messiah was freed from prison.

In an informative and inspirational speech, H.E. Mr. F.K. Morule elucidated the real essence of International Mandela Day to come forward and spend 67 minutes each day to serve mankind. He emphasized on the need to live the legacy of this iconic man and recreate a global community on the ideals of tolerance, compassion, humility and international understanding. He further expressed his solidarity with the people of Palestine in their struggle for freedom.

The icing on the cake was to hear Mrs. Rajni Kumar, Founder of the Africa Club and Chairperson, Springdales Education Society relating her journey from the inception of the club to her steadfast support for the Africans in their fight for democracy.

The festive morning concluded with the singing of the National Anthems of South Africa and India</p>

    <section id="FAQ" style="width: 100%;">
        <h1>FAQ</h1>
       <p>There are, in total, 110 large and spacious classrooms each equipped with the latest audio-visual equipment; in addition a there's a well-stocked library with a comprehensive collection of educational books and multi-media resources; art, dance, and music studios; and state-of-the-art-science laboratories.

In addition to the academic programme, the school also offers a Pupil Enhancement Programme which is mandatory for students from Grades 3 to 10 and optional for Grades 1 and 2.  The aim is to provide extra-curricular activities revolving around physical, social and intellectual ECA's. The school aims for every child to get an equal opportunity to participate in variety of activities and make use of state-of-art facilities and infrastructure available.

These include Cultural Activities such as Classical dance, Western dance, Vocal music, Instrumental Music, Painting, Dramatics, Debating, Public Speaking; Sports such as Cricket, Aerobics, Yoga, Football, Basketball, Volleyball, Lawn Tennis, Badminton and Swimming; and Language including French, German, Spanish and Arabic.

The Stats

The school currently has some 1,200 students to its purpose-built campus in Al Quoz, from 27 different nationalities. According to the school approximately 20-30% of students come from overseas, and the balance transfers from other schools in Dubai and neighbouring Emirates. The school offers pre-KG through to Grade 11.

Teachers have been recruited from India, Pakistan, Italy, United Arab Emirates, Philippines, Sri Lanka, Egypt, Sudan, Tunisia and Uzbekistan.  The majority are from India, but for the second time, the school has recruited a Principal from the UK.  Both the current and former Principals have experience of senior positions at schools in Dubai, which would have supported the school's drive to attain and subsequently improve its KHDA rating.

What do the Inspectors Say 2017/2018

The previous 2016-17 report downgraded the school from Good to Acceptable, mainly due to a drop in student attainment and progress in core subjects, most noticeable in the middle school. This was likely linked to the drop in teaching and assessment in the middle grades. As the report noted, "differentiation of learning, although often referred to in planning, is rarely implemented and the needs of groups of students are not met adequately". There was a limited variety of teaching strategies used and often a 'one size fits all' approach.

In the 2017-18 inspection round, Springdales has been able to attain its Good rating again. This has been driven by the whole school drive to secure improvements in teaching, learning skills and assessment. Almost all teachers who responded to the KHDA pre-inspection survey, were very supportive of the developments made to systematically use data to improve learning and teaching. They were very appreciative of the professional development they receive, expressing a clear commitment to applying this new expertise to create positive learning experiences. These findings were supported by the inspection judgments.

Attainment and Progress in English, Mathematics and Science were found to be good in Kindergarten. In the primary, Middle and Secondary phases, attainment and progress in the core subjects were also good, with the exception and progress in mathematics in secondary which is very good. Attainment in Arabic as addition language was found to be weak in primary and middle phases, but progress is acceptable. Islamic education was deemed to be good for both attainment and progress in the middle and secondary phase. The overall picture of student’s achievement is consistent. </p>
